I want to build a web app where i will upload a podcast audio then, it creates the video, a 3d representation of a podcast, with two speakers, male and female, when male speaks the 3d object moves depicting human movemnt in a podcast studio and when woman speaks the same happens, se how we will achieve this, create a folder where we will store all our code

Let's outline the steps to achieve this in Google Colab.

1. Project Setup:

First, create a folder in your Google Drive to store all your project files.

import os

project_folder = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Podcast3DVisualizer"
os.makedirs(project_folder, exist_ok=True)
os.chdir(project_folder)

print(f"Project folder created at: {project_folder}")
Use code with caution
This code snippet creates a folder named Podcast3DVisualizer in your Google Drive and changes the current working directory to this new folder.

2. Audio Processing:

You'll need to process the podcast audio to detect who is speaking (male or female) and when. This involves speaker diarization. Libraries like pyannote.audio can be helpful for this. You'll also need to install these libraries.

!pip install pyannote.audio==3.1.1

# Example of loading an audio file
# from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
# pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1", use_auth_token="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN")
# diarization = pipeline("your_audio_file.wav")
# for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
#     print(f"start={turn.start:.1f}s stop={turn.end:.1f}s speaker_{speaker}")
Use code with caution
Remember to replace "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN" with your actual token if you use pyannote.audio.

3. 3D Model Creation and Animation:

You'll need 3D models for the male and female speakers and a podcast studio environment. You can create these using 3D modeling software (like Blender) or find pre-made models online.

Animating these models based on the speaker diarization data requires a 3D rendering engine or library that can handle real-time animation. Libraries like BlenderProc can be used to script Blender for rendering.

!pip install blenderproc==2.2.1

# Example of rendering in Blender (this is complex and requires setting up Blender)
# import blenderproc as bproc
# bproc.init()
# # Load your 3D models and setup the scene
# # Animate the models based on speaker diarization data
# # Render the frames
# data = bproc.render_pipeline()
Use code with caution
This step is the most complex and requires significant knowledge of 3D graphics and animation.

4. Video Creation:

Once you have the rendered frames from the 3D scene, you'll need to combine them to create a video. Libraries like OpenCV or moviepy can be used for this.

!pip install opencv-python==4.8.1.78 moviepy==1.0.3

# Example using moviepy (simplified)
# from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip
# import glob
#
# image_files = sorted(glob.glob("rendered_frames/*.png"))
# clip = ImageSequenceClip(image_files, fps=24) # Adjust fps as needed
# clip.write_videofile("podcast_video.mp4")
Use code with caution
This code snippet shows how to create a video from a sequence of images using moviepy.

5. Web App Development:

Finally, you'll need to build a web application to handle audio uploads, trigger the processing pipeline, and display the resulting video. Frameworks like Flask or Django can be used for this. This will involve creating an interface for users to upload their audio files and receive the generated video.

This is a high-level overview, and each step involves significant technical challenges. You'll need to integrate these steps, handle file uploads and storage, and build a user-friendly interface for your web app.

for the 3d image, its not a must it be 3d object if that is out of scope, be creative with that, the idea is user retention we want our users to actually watch something rather that see a static image

Okay, if creating full 3D rendered scenes is too complex, we can explore alternative visual representations to keep users engaged. The key is to have dynamic visuals that respond to the audio.

Here are some creative alternatives for visual representation that are more manageable in Google Colab:

1. Animated Avatars or Characters:

Instead of complex 3D models, you could use pre-designed animated avatars or characters. These could be 2D or simpler 3D representations that have pre-defined animations (like head nods, hand gestures, lip-syncing) that you can trigger based on the speaker detection.

You could find libraries or resources that provide animated avatars that can be controlled via code.
The animation triggers would be based on the speaker diarization data (e.g., when male speaks, trigger male avatar's animation).
2. Dynamic Visualizations:

You can create abstract or data-driven visualizations that react to the audio.

Audio Waveforms: Displaying animated waveforms that change color or shape based on the speaker.
Spectrograms: Visualizing the frequency content of the audio, with different colors or patterns for each speaker.
Abstract Animations: Creating simple geometric shapes or patterns that animate in response to the audio rhythm or speaker changes.
3. Text-Based Animations:

If you also transcribe the podcast, you could display the text with animated effects, highlighting the speaker's lines as they are spoken.

This could involve simple text animations like fading in/out, changing color, or using different fonts/sizes for each speaker.
How to Achieve This in Colab:

Audio Processing: You'll still need to perform speaker diarization to identify who is speaking and when. The techniques described earlier using libraries like pyannote.audio are still relevant.
Visual Generation: Instead of rendering 3D scenes, you'll generate a sequence of images or a video using libraries that can create dynamic visuals based on the audio analysis.
Matplotlib or Plotly: For creating animated graphs and visualizations.
Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation and creating simple animations by generating a sequence of images.
OpenCV or moviepy: To combine the generated images into a video.
Example using Matplotlib for a simple animated waveform:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import moviepy.editor as mp
import os

# Assume you have audio data and speaker labels (male/female)

def create_waveform_frame(audio_data, speaker_label, frame_number):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    color = 'blue' if speaker_label == 'male' else 'red'
    plt.plot(audio_data, color=color)
    plt.title(f"Frame {frame_number} - Speaker: {speaker_label}")
    plt.axis('off')
    filename = f"frame_{frame_number:04d}.png"
    plt.savefig(filename)
    plt.close()
    return filename

# This is a simplified example. You'd need to slice your audio data
# and get speaker labels for each frame based on diarization.
# Let's assume you have a list of (audio_chunk, speaker_label) pairs.
# For demonstration, let's create some dummy data.
dummy_audio_data = [np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, 100)) * (i + 1) for i in range(20)]
dummy_speaker_labels = ['male' if i % 2 == 0 else 'female' for i in range(20)]

image_files = []
for i, (audio_chunk, speaker_label) in enumerate(zip(dummy_audio_data, dummy_speaker_labels)):
    filename = create_waveform_frame(audio_chunk, speaker_label, i)
    image_files.append(filename)

# Create video from frames
clip = mp.ImageSequenceClip(image_files, fps=10) # Adjust fps as needed
clip.write_videofile("animated_waveform.mp4", codec='libx264')

print("Video created: animated_waveform.mp4")

# Clean up image files
for img_file in image_files:
    os.remove(img_file)
Use code with caution
This example shows how to create a sequence of images displaying an animated waveform with different colors based on the speaker, and then assemble them into a video. You would need to adapt this to your actual audio processing and speaker diarization results.

The key takeaway is to focus on creating engaging visual feedback that is directly linked to the audio analysis, even if it's not a full 3D render.
